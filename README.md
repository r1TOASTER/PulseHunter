# PulseHunter

PulseHunter is a network tool for examining ports on a given IP address. It allows you to check whether a specific port is open or closed.
## Compiling

To compile PulseHunter, you will need a C++ compiler and the **iphlpapi** and **ws2_32** libraries.

Here is an example of how to compile PulseHunter in Visual Studio Code using the C++ extension:

1. Create a bin folder in the root directory of the project.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open the terminal by pressing ```Ctrl + Shift + ~```.
4. Run the following command to generate the executable file:
```
g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -g -Wall -pedantic -Werror ${workspaceFolder}\\src\\*.cpp -o ${workspaceFolder}\\bin\\PulseHunter.exe -liphlpapi -lws2_32
```
This command will generate an executable file named PulseHunter.exe in the bin folder.
## Usage

To use PulseHunter, simply run the executable file and follow the prompts. The program currently allows you to check the open ports running on your pc (UDP and TCP).

Future updates to the program will include:

- [ ] User interface (choosing what to do and more)
- [ ] Scanning ports by their status: open, established, and more
- [ ] Scanning IP addresses that are open for the ports (host/source)
